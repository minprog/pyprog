- draw

- abstraction
move player with keyboard
class Vector2, operators, help(pygame.Vector2)
make player class (hide position, speed, color, ...)

- inheritance (code duplicate)
share variables: position, speed, ... with Alien
share functions: step, ...
__init__, super()

- polymorphism
list of different units
another unit type

- (static) class variables
color, radius, ...
local, class, instance variables
spawn chance
counting different units: __del__, super()

- operators/function of Vector2
bounce
bounce bug, prev_pos
non-collisoin spawn?

- type hierarchy
get_hit_points()
use methods not isinstanceof()
use single-dispatch for functions
use double-dispatch (@multimethod)


angle
bullets
mouse clicks
